What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
- Specific quantization technique, namely GPFQ, and gave us the intuition behind how alphabets and the technique work mathematically.
Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
- I would like to explore the application of GPFQ, specifically in the case of quantizing a model where we are only interested in a subset of data, instead of all of the training classes.
What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
- I would like to try other networks, especially ones that are pretrained on datasets other than ImageNet to see how the results may be replicated in another arcitecture.
What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
- In our quarter 2 project, we would have to use techniques to compare distribution of data subsets, and I am interested in seeing how we will approach this technique. We will also see if we can introduct mix-precision quantization in the project.
